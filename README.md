- 👋 Hi, I’m @CH-AndrewMaibach
- 👀 I’m interested in endurance training, and breaking down complex problems into finite, tangible actions that we can do now (let's focus on what we can do, and if that's heading in the right direction).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to organize my work and life into one concise and organized framework - how can I try to limit the lift of my brain power?e
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things related to product management, triathlon, product workflows @ CH, and really just about anything you want to tell me about.
- 📫 How to reach me - andrew.maibach@collectivehealth.com, andrew.maibach@gmail.com
